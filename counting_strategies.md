# Counting Strategies

## Strategy 1:
### Hi-Lo

The most basic counting strategy. It works by assigning integer values to each card and tracking the count based on what has been shown. This count determines how you should change your bets or even deviate from basic strategy.
High cards benefit the player, low cards benefit the dealer.

#### Value Assignment:
* Cards 2–6: +1  
* Cards 7–9: 0  
* Cards 10–A: -1  

#### How to Use It:
At the beginning of a shoe, start with a **running count** of 0. As cards are dealt, you **add or subtract** from the running count based on each card’s value:

**Example:**
* 5♦ is dealt → running count = **+1**  
* 2♣ follows → running count = **+2**  
* K♣ follows → running count = **+1**

Repeat this for every card you see—whether dealt to you, the dealer, or other players.

#### Converting to True Count:
In multi-deck games (like 6 or 8-deck shoes), the running count isn’t enough. You need to convert it to the **true count**, which adjusts for how many decks remain.

> **True Count = Running Count / Estimated Decks Remaining**

Example:
- Running count = +6  
- ~3 decks left in the shoe  
- **True count = +2**

#### When to adjust bets:
* True count <= 0 --> bet minimum
* True count >= +2 --> increase bet
* True count >= +4 --> max bet

High true count --> more 10s and aces are left in the shoe

#### Advantages:
- Easy to learn and fast to use
- Widely accepted and proven effective
- Balanced system (running count returns to 0 after full deck)

#### Things to Practice:
- Count multiple cards at once (e.g., whole hands)
- Estimate decks remaining visually
- Stay accurate under pressure
